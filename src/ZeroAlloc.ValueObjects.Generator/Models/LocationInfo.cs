/// The tree is kept, not just its file path, because the rebuilt diagnostic must be a source
/// location. <c>Location.Create(filePath, span, lineSpan)</c> gives an external-file location

/// <c>#pragma warning disable</c> and per-file severity settings for it.

/// <para>
/// Keeping the tree does not defeat caching. <see cref="SyntaxTree"/> compares by reference, and
/// a compilation reuses the tree instance of every file that did not change, so the location
/// compares equal across runs until its own file is edited, when the model is rebuilt anyway. A
/// tree belongs to no one compilation, and only the tree of the latest run is held.
